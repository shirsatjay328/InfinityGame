Consumers and businesses alike are increasingly purchasing horse fat and horse fat-based products from e-commerce websites and digital marketplaces. The convenience of browsing products, comparing prices, and having access to a wide range of options has significantly boosted the market. Additionally, the rise of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands has contributed to the accessibility of horse fat-based products, allowing smaller companies to tap into the global market. Social media and influencer marketing also play a role in driving consumer interest, particularly in industries like cosmetics, where the effectiveness of products made with horse fat is often highlighted by user reviews and tutorials.The growth of the online market is not limited to consumer products but also includes business-to-business (B2B) transactions.
